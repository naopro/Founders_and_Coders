      <h3>2011: GCSE IT Class</h3>
      <h4>📍 Cambridge</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        My first exposure to HTML and CSS was during a poorly-taught GCSE class, in a
        poorly-lit classroom. The tools I had to my disposal were Windows Vista, Adobe Dreamweaver and
        Internet Explorer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite the drab teaching, I was fascinated that a few scores of code could create such
        interesting and engaging content, and that anyone (even me!) could make such
        content available to the whole world.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, my skills did not go much further than a basic table
        structured websites, modifying Tumblr Themes and 'hacking' webpages
        i.e. making humorous adjustments to the HTML of BBC News headlines.

      <h3>2014: University</h3>
      <h4>📍 Norwich</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        While studying for a law degree, I picked up <i>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</i> by Jon Duckett and
        continued to play around with basic code, this time on Wordpress, but also with very little success.

      <h3>Late 2018 - Summer 2019</h3>
      <h4>📍 New York City</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I spent long days in a window-less office so, when I wasn't at work, I was enjoying all that the city had to
        offer.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I wasn't out and about (i.e. the week before payday) I was indoors cooking up a storm or
        coding using Python 3. I learned the basics at a half-day session at
        the New York Public Library and then the rest from YouTube, Lynda
        and trusty Google Search.
        <br /><br />
        I surprised myself in successfully creating a short script to
        make my days of monotonous document review more efficent.
        <br />
        <br />
        While I enjoyed learning Python, I
        greatly disliked its lacking of visuals results and that it had few
        opportunities to show off creativity, other than perhaps, Turtle!

        Summer 2020: Founders and Coders?
      </h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I am confident that coding, specifically web development, combines my interests of problem-solving and being
        creativity.<br />
        Whilst my first exposure to web development was almost 10 years ago, when I
        was 16 years old, it still managed to find its way back onto my radar.<br />
        Transitioning from the law to participating in Founders and Coders would be certainly be a big and challenging
        step, which I think would be in the right directin. I will approach the course with drive, determination and
        passion in order to make web developement a career and not just a hobby.
