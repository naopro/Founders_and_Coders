                        👩🏽‍🎓 I am a 24 year old LLM student, with a serious inkling that the law may just not be for me.<br>
                        🤔 Riddle me this. How many lawyers do you know that are interested in coding and web development? I rest my case.<br>
                        🕠 Outside of my studies I enjoy: 💻 coding (obviously) 🧁 baking 📚 reading 📸 photography and 💃🏽 dancing. It is questionable as to how well I do the latter.

                        ❓ You're probably thinking: 'why would a lawyer want to get into web design?' Good question.<br>
                        💡 Coding, specifically web development (and some Python here and there) combines my interests of problem solving and creativity.
