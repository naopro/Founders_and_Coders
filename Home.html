      <h3>2011: GCSE IT Class</h3>
      <h4>üìç Cambridge</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        My first exposure to HTML and CSS was during a poorly-taught GCSE class in a
        poorly-lit classroom. The tools I had to my disposal were Windows Vista, Adobe Dreamweaver and
        Internet Explorer coupled with a seriously slow internet connection.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite the drab teaching, I was fascinated that a few scores of code could create such
        interesting and engaging content, and that anyone (even me!) could make such
        content available to the whole world.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, my skills did not go much further than a basic table
        structured websites, modifying Tumblr Themes and 'hacking' webpages
        i.e. making humorous adjustments to the HTML of BBC News headlines.

      <h3>2014: University</h3>
      <h4>üìç Norwich</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        While studying for a law degree, I picked up <i>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</i> by Jon Duckett and
        continued to play around with basic code, this time on Wordpress, but also with very little success.

      <h3>2016 - 2018: Paralegal Life</h3>
      <h4>üìç London</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I was fortunate to get a Paralegal role straight out of University and I was surprisingly required to apply my
        knowledge of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS while acting for a client on copyright infringement claim. I
        analysed the code of their reputable website and compare it with a copycat site that was being hosted in
        Thailand, highlighting the similarities in the text and the visual effects their implentation had.
        <br>
        <br>
        I never would have considered that my coding skills would have come in useful in a law office. That occurrence
        reignited the spark of interest I had in web development and I proceeded to read more about the topic, playing
        about with basic HTML and CSS but what I lacked was a goal or project.

      <h3>Late 2018 - Summer 2019</h3>
      <h4>üìç New York City</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I spent long days in a window-less office so, when I wasn't at work, I was enjoying all that the city had to
        offer.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I wasn't out and about (i.e. the week before payday) I was indoors cooking up a storm or
        coding using Python 3. I learned the basics at a half-day session at
        the New York Public Library and then the rest from YouTube, Lynda
        and trusty Google Search.
        <br>
        <br>
        I surprised myself in successfully creating a short script to
        make my days of monotonous document review more efficent.
        <br>
        <br>
        While I enjoyed learning Python, I
        greatly disliked its lacking of visuals results and that it had few
        opportunities to show off creativity, other than perhaps, Turtle.

      <h3>
        Spring 2020
      </h3>
      <h4>üìç Cambridge, UK</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Upon my return, I enrolled on my Masters but I was determined to enrol on a coding course
        simultaneously.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fortunately, Code First Girls were launching an Introduction to Web Development evening course a short bus
        ride
        from my university and I was accepted. Over eight weeks, I refreshed my knowledge of the basics of HTML and
        CSS
        and supplemented it with some basic JavaScript.
        <br>
        <br>
        As part of the course, I worked with two others to develop <a
          href="https://naopro.github.io/codefirstgirlproject/holiday.html">Travel For Good</a>, a bespoke holiday
        booking platform for conscious travellers. I personally developed the Booking Form landing page and as team,
        the
        website won us an
        award
        for excellence.

      <h3>
        Summer 2020: Founders and Coders?
      </h3>
      <h4>üìç Space4 (or via Zoom)? </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I am confident that coding, specifically web development, combines my skills of problem-solving and attention
        to
        detail with my desire to be creative. Over the years, I have become increasingly disillusioned by the law and
        therefore seek an escape
        before it is too late.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whilst my first exposure to web development was almost 10 years ago, when I
        was 16 years old, it still managed to find its way back onto my radar.
        <br>
        <br>
        Transitioning from the law to participating in Founders and Coders would be certainly be a big and challenging
        step, which I think would be in the right directin. I will approach the course with drive, determination and
        passion in order to make web developement a career and not just a hobby.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would be extremely grateful for this opportunity to develop my skills, meet other like-minded people and
        become part of the mentor team for the next cohort.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for considering my application.
