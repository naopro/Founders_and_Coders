                        👩🏽‍🎓 I am a 24 year old LLM student, with a serious inkling that the law may just not be for me.<br>
                        🤔 Riddle me this. How many lawyers do you know that are interested in coding and web development? I rest my case.<br>
                        🕠 Outside of my studies I enjoy: 💻 coding (obviously) 🧁 baking 📚 reading 📸 photography and 💃🏽 dancing. It is questionable as to how well I do the latter.

                        ❓ You're probably thinking: 'why would a lawyer want to get into web design?' Good question.<br>
                        💡 Coding, specifically web development (and some Python here and there) combines my interests of problem solving and creativity.<br>
                        My first exposure to web development was when I was 16 years old, while doing my GCSEs. I was fascinated that a few lines of code could create such interesting content,
                        and that anyone could make this content available to the whole world. However, my skills did not go much further than spending time 'hacking' webpages i.e. making humorous adjustments to BBC News headlines.
